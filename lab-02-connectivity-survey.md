# Lab 2: IBM Cloud + IKS connectivity check - Slack Survey

We use beyond poll in Slack to see how far the participants are. We use Public votes and multiple select as poll options.

```bash
/poll "Lab 2 Connectivity - Survey" "Login to cloud.ibm.com works" "I can switch to the IBM Workshop Account and see the Kubernetes cluster" "I can connect to the cluster with IBM Cloud Shell" "I cann connect to the cluster from my own ibmcloud + kubernetes CLI setup"
```
